# Sample_Dataset_afterprocess
There are two samples of our Dataset. One is CC attack data, the other is non-cc attack data.
Both two files have been processed to hide the private field('IP').
Because all the data comes from real network traffic and may involve the users' private information, we cannot disclose it all. If you have academic research needs, please contact my email.
